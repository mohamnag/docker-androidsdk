# Android SDK
Provides a series of images for different build and CI setups.

These is no latest tag, so just lookup tags on [docker hub](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/mohamnag/androidsdk/tags) for different setups.

Based on images from [azabost/android-sdk](https://github.com/azabost/android-sdk).
